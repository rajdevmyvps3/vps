### 🎀 Mods( Must be added ):
- Mods are the people who can use `mod` commands like: `ban`, `unban`, `mute`, `unmute`, `add`, `remove` etc.
- In other works they are Maintainers of the bot.
- You can add multiple mods by separating their numbers with `,` like: `918434573266,927811946570` etc. where `91` is country code and `8434573266` is phone number. ( Do not use international format like: `+91 8434573266` or `+918434573266` etc. And also do not use `0` before country code like: `0918434573266` etc.)
